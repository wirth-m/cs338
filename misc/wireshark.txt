===== DAYTIME =====

1. These are the frame summaries of the TCP handshake, as captured by Wireshark:
1	0.000000000	192.168.249.128	129.6.15.28	TCP	74	44718 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=1404835580 TSecr=0 WS=128
2	0.034294207	129.6.15.28	192.168.249.128	TCP	60	13 → 44718 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460
3	0.034349294	192.168.249.128	129.6.15.28	TCP	54	44718 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0

2. The client is using the port 44718.

3. The following frame contains the actual date and time:
4	0.068486167	129.6.15.28	192.168.249.128	DAYTIME	105	DAYTIME Response

4.  This is the full content of that frame, with labels in brackets:
59672 [modified Julian date, see source 1] 22-04-03 [year-month-day] 20:36:16 [hour:minute:second] 50 [indicates that we're on daylight savings time, see source 2] 0 [leap second, see source 1] 0 [server health, see source 1] 307.1 [time code accounting for network delays, measured in milliseconds, see source 1] UTC(NIST) [Server that is accessed] * [on time indicator, see source 1]
Source 1: https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?p=8785
Source 2: https://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1046.pdf
Note that, while Source 1 was found first and used to answer most of these questions, Source 2 also provides this information (p. 508-509).

5. [SYN] stands for "synchronize," marking the initiation of communication between the client and the server. 

6. [ACK] means "acknowledge," as the client and server acknowledge the other's previous communication. 

7. [FIN] refers to "finalize," marking the end of the connection.

8. According to Wireshark, the client initiated the closing of the connection.  This is evident because the client sent the [FIN] frame.

===== HTTP =====

1. Based on the protocol field of Wireshark, 106 TCP connections were opened.

2. Your homepage, index.html, was requested in frame 28: 
28	0.166324113	192.168.249.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	403	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

3. Your headshot, jeff_square_head.jpg, was requested in frame 32: 
32	0.266099840	192.168.249.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	372	GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1

===== QUESTIONS =====
What is a favicon? Requested in frame 115	(0.421441009	192.168.249.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	363	GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1) 
Is TLSv1.2 an encrpytion protocol?  How often does it change keys?	
What does PSH mean in the context of a TCP protocol?
What is the significance of the color coding in WireShark?
How does the client know what to request?  For example, my client asks for the specific name of the image file (jeff_square_head.jpg) but that is not provided by the user.
