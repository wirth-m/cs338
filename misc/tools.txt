1: The IP address of my personal computer is 172.17.134.242 according to the command ifcongig (mentioned in class by Jeff Ondich).  The IP address for my instance of Kali running on VMware is 192.168.249.128.

2: You can use the ping command followed by the hostname (URL) to find the IP address of a given host.  I used this command to find the IP address of cs.carleton.edu (137.22.5.8) (Source: https://www.dotcom-monitor.com/wiki/knowledge-base/target-hostname-or-ip-address/#:~:text=In%20an%20open%20command%20line,web%20resource%20in%20the%20response). 

3: You can use the nslookup command followed by the IP address to find the host name in some cases (Source: https://smallbusiness.chron.com/ping-computer-behind-router-58692.html).  The nmap command can also be used to find the host name if given an IP address instead of a host name.  Online lookup tools like https://lookup.icann.org/ may be easier to use in some instances (Source: https://www.dotcom-monitor.com/wiki/knowledge-base/target-hostname-or-ip-address/#:~:text=In%20an%20open%20command%20line,web%20resource%20in%20the%20response.).  This particular online service will list private users under the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority contact information, listed as a Private Address.

4: The scp command followed by the file name and desired new location/filepath can be used to copy files across machines (mentioned in class by Jeff Ondich).  The curl command followed by -t has an option to transfer a file to a new location (in the curl command documentation found by entering curl -help in the command line).

5: You can use the nmap command followed by the hosname (URL) -p and then the range of ports you'd like to see.  This works with one port or a range (Source: https://nmap.org/book/man-port-specification.html).

6: The nmap command, followed by the hostname (URL), provides a summary of the listening ports, including if they are open or filtered.  Closed ports are not shown (Source: https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html and https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-listening-port).

7: Use the command wget followed by the url (Source: https://linuxize.com/post/wget-command-examples/).

8: Use the command curl followed by -i and then the URL (Source: https://serverfault.com/questions/249483/shell-command-to-see-the-http-headers).

9: Use the command curl followed by -v and then the URL (Source: https://serverfault.com/questions/249483/shell-command-to-see-the-http-headers).
